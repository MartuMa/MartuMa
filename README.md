We want to be looking at a “daytrading” bot that will mostly focus on following a weekly 2 candle theory, to read and understand the markets through the movements of candles. We will have to know where in the market we are – the opening of the different candles. 

We can look at the monthly candle. One monthly candle is built up from 4x weekly candles. If the previous monthly candle closed bullish, this would mean that we expect that the next monthly candle (and price) will continue going up, and close bullish. It will create higher highs. But the candle also must create a monthly wick. The time and place of the two-candle patterns can provide additional information about potential price movements. Time of Day: The time of day when the two-candle pattern forms can influence its reliability. For example, patterns that form during high-volume trading hours (like the opening and closing hours of major markets) may be more reliable than those that form during low-volume hours. The bodies and wicks of the candles are being created. 
When the wicks get formed in a bullish market (sentiment), it means that the price must create lower lows and lower highs on the lower timeframes, before creating highs and then a body - or creating the highs before creating the lows, and then the body. The next candle must create a wick – that will be generated by a significant point on a lower timeframe – that was generated by either a Break-of-structure – or a change-or-character. 
Break-of-Structure and Change of character are significant points we must know, and understand through conditions, rules and the understanding of structure, and how the price moves. The different candles are built up through the significant levels. These levels could be looked at as support and resistance, horizontal lines in the market. You may expect a reaction from these levels – the creation of wicks, highs and bodies of higher levelled candles. But we never know exactly where the price will reverse and have the reaction. 
We can read the movements of the continuation of the build-up of the candles through different significant points. These points could be looked at as supply-and-demand zones. So for a monthly candle, we can focus and look at the highs (of the total structure of price – multiple bullish and/or bearish candles that create higher highs and higher lows or visa versa) that build up the monthly candle through the creation of the basecandles – and the generated supply and demand zones from these generated zones. We have different base candles created through candlesticks like engulfing candles, inside bar candles, doji candles, pin bar candles, and hammer candles. We already have scripts created to identify most of the candlesticks – some may be modified with time and more understanding. 
These zones are created through the point in the market that started the movement that generated the newest highest high, that went and broke the high, where the true body closed over the zone created – it created a new significant point. Buyers overcame sellers, through the brokage of a previous wick of a higher time frames candlestick or opposite for sellers. 

These zones that are broken through the creation of wicks, highs an lows, can be looked as break-of-structure (bos) and change of character (choch – the change of sentiment in the market). 
If we can understand the connection through the generated supply and demand zones, and the support and resistance zones that creates the middle of the candle (50% fibonacci level of the candle (wither through wick to wick, or the top and bottom of the body of the candle), the highest point of the candle (either HH or LH) or the lowest point of the candle (LL or HL). The creation of choch and bos is from the breakage of the points – and the generated supply and demand zones generate the wicks of the higher timeframes candles. We must understand how and why the market moves so quickly at one point (most likely broken through a significant point – then has a pullback (testing of the significant area), to have a continuation (crating of new highs/lows and the body of a candle on a higher timeframe). We may often see when a significant level is broken, and the candles on the important timeframes that are valuable to understand that level, has closed above the significant level, the price and market will move back to the demand/supply-zone that generated that new high/low over/under the significant level. 
The market often generates correction zones (supply and demand-zone that move against the main trend), when the market moves towards these zones that created and broke the significant point. These zones can be defines through break-of-structure and change-of-character, and will go through the timeframes from low to high, and high to low. It is paramount that we remember that we understand how the different candles and timeframes are built up from high to small – and small to high. 

We notice that when the price is moving bullish, the ‘l’ (the lowest wick of the bullish monthly candle) almost never gets broken, but the previous highs does get broken. When the price gets broken, its with a significant point in the market -> a support or resistance line, a HH/LH or a LL/HL. This may also be looked at as generated patterns like head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, rising wedge pattern, descending wedge pattern (and more) that we can generate a set of rules for – and codes that will look for these patterns. These generated patterns will be the creation of candles, through the movement of the market and the generated creation of wicks, zones, levels and bodies. 
Through following the creation of candles, we can notice and look where the volume of money goes through the different currencies. We may begin to understand the currency strength of all the different currencies. So when a currency pair, indice or cryptocurrency moves againt the expected currency strength, we can notice if there’s a currency correlation between the pairs and currency. We can see if there’s two strong currencies – that generate a difficult market – or a strong currency that’s against a really week and we have a lot more strong signal – and we can be on the right side of the markets sentiment and the right side of the creation of wick, high/low and closing of the body, and the creation of the next wick, high/low and closing of the body. 
We can go risk free if we see the market moves above the safe significant points, etc. Have TP where the next significant points are (support, demand, resistance, supply, etc). SL under demand and supply – zones, or the demand and supply zones of the higher timeframes, where the market must move to create a candle of the higher timeframes. We have to be vary of, just because a demand/supply-zone has been broken on a timeframe and have created a choch, it may not be the change of the market sentiment, but the generated wick/high/low/lower high/higher low of a higher timeframes candle.  


Here's what we need:

Generate Python code for various modules of our trading bot. These modules include data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, model evaluation, signal generation, and more.
Run the generated code in the Cloud9 IDE and return the output or any errors that occur.
Analyze the output or errors to identify any issues or improvements that can be made.
Update the scripts based on the analysis to fix any errors and make improvements.
Ensure that the bot can operate autonomously on AWS Fargate or AWS Lambda, interact with the Oanda API for trading operations, store error logs in the S3 bucket, and store time-series data in Timestream.
Ensure that the bot is robust and reliable enough to operate in a real-world trading scenario.
We appreciate your assistance with this project. Please let us know if you need any more information to get started."
This is our directory of files. We have all the files created there. All folders has the __init.__.py in them.

We will now start working on this data folder. We need our data to get fetched, cleaned, stroed, logged, transformed, extracted, etc.
Please ask if you need to see any scripts to better understand what and where we’re at.
